                    Community-level moderation for Reddit and similar platforms is a complex task. Our analysis show that <strong> subreddits are constantly changing and therefore timely interventions are prohibitively expesnsive </strong> because of the scale. To address this issue, we propose a flagging tool which aids administrators by <strong> flagging subreddits that exhibit similarly problematic behavior as seen in previously banned communities </strong>.

                    Studying the inconsistencies in Reddit's community-level interventions we observe that negative attention from media towards a subreddit is significantly more likely to result in a ban of a subreddit than high levels of toxicity within the community.<strong> Our results conclude that Reddit's incentives for banning a community are primarily to maintain an image of a civil platform (reactively) </strong>. Measuring whether these misaligned incentives effect the effectiveness of interventions -- <strong>we see media attention can at times exacerbate and promote problematic behavior</strong>.

                    Online radicalization has been observed to be one of the significant dangers of social media. By measuring users levels of radicalization, we identify online triggers that lead to misogynistic radicalization. We focus entirely on fundamental engagement events and measure their impact on user's behavior. Our findings from a randomized treatment-control experiment show that <strong> participation in problematic communities, interaction with radical users and social status in a platform can influence significant increase in problematic behavior </strong>.
