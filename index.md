I am a Computer Science graduate of FAST NUCES Lahore and now a
prospective graduate student. My interests include Machine Learning, 
Computer Vision, Security and Privacy. I am currently working on 
Cyber Security and Machine Learning at TPI Lab in LUMS.

I also like tinker with python and solve problems using automation. I like
reading books and watching football.

In my next life I am an author and journalist.
