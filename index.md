I am a Computer Science graduate from FAST NUCES Lahore and now a
prospective graduate student. I am currently working on 
Cyber Security and Machine Learning at TPI Lab in LUMS.

I like tinker with python and solve problems using automation. I enjoy
reading books and watching football.

My interests include Machine Learning, Computer Vision, Security and Privacy.
