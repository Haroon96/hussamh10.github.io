I am a PhD student at The University of Iowa in Computer Science advised by [Dr. Rishab Nithyanand](https://sparta.cs.uiowa.edu/people/rishab/) and working in the [SPARTA lab](https://sparta.cs.uiowa.edu). My research topics are security, privacy and anonymity. Previously, I worked in the [TPI lab](http://www.tpilums.org/) at LUMS on network security and internet measurement under the supervision of [Dr. Fareed Zaffar](https://lums.edu.pk/lums_employee/422).

I am also the Co-founder and CTO of [OMNO AI](https://www.omno.ai/) where we work on Computer Vision and Machine Learning.
