Hi! I am Hussam Habib (حسام حبیب). I am a third year PhD student at The University of Iowa in Computer Science advised by [Dr. Rishab Nithyanand](https://sparta.cs.uiowa.edu/people/rishab/) and working in the [SPARTA lab](https://sparta.cs.uiowa.edu). My research interests are computational social science, online moderation and studying radicalization on online platforms.

I am also the Co-founder of [OMNO AI](http://www.omno.ai/) working on Computer Vision and Machine Learning.

# Research
<hr>

#### Radicalization and Interventions
Tracking online vulnerable users for radicalization and monitoring the 
triggering events. Exploring the events to suggest mitigation and intervention techniques.
<br/>

<b>Act or React</b> — Submitted ICWSM’22
<i>Investigating Proactive Strategies For Online Community Moderation</i>
We study Reddit for online community evolution, impact of community participation on user behavior and effectiveness of community moderation
<br/>

#### Reactive Moderation — Submitted ICWSM’22
<i>Exploring the magnitude and effects of media influence on Reddit moderation </i>
We study media’s influence on Reddit’s administrative actions and measure the inadvertent propagation of dangerous ideas by media.

#### Data Void Provenance
Isolating narratives and frames in news media and online forums and tracking the flow of information from
underground forums to the mainstream.
<br/>

#### Information Flow - A Survey
A survey on understanding Information flow using different perspectives.
We organize recent research done to understand dynamics information flow on social
media by the factors they use. [pdf](./paper.pdf)
<br/>


#### Android Repackaging Analysis
Measurement study on the prevalence of repackaged and malicious apps on major Chinese apps stores and communities for cracked apps. 
<br/>

#### Provenance Malware Detection — Detecting malicious activity using provenance graphs
We summarize provenance graphs created using SPADE and use template matching for malware detection
<br/>

#### [YENET](https://github.com/hussamh10/yenet)
This research project aims to design a model that reconstructs the missing video frames from a video using audio reinforcement and motion vectors.

#### Adlytic
We use computer vision and machine learning to detect traffic demographic and individual attributes to provide better impressions to advertisement agencies and customized experienced to viewers
#### Trafflytic
We track traffic using low quality cameras and generate real time analytics such as counts, congestion scores and traffic speeds
#### Digital Salon
We integrate salons with smart tools aiding them to increase sales and significantly improve a user experience. We use computer vision and generative models to provide clients with style and treatment recommendation such as hair color, hair style, hair length, facial, makeup, acne treatment etc

# Other Projects

#### [Fetch](https://github.com/hussamh10/fetch)
A search engine for Windows with an intuitive GUI that uses approximate search algorithms to instantly find files folders.
<br/>

#### [AlfredPi](https://github.com/hussamh10/alfredpi):
A Raspberry Pi bot that automates day to day routine such as downloading media, reminders, calendar management, internet searches, home surveillance.
